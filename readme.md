# Single Linked List Pygame

This project is an implementation of a **single linked list** visualized in real-time using **Pygame**. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of data structures in a graphical environment, making it easier to understand linked list concepts.

## Features

- **Graphical Visualization**: Each node is visually represented with connections showing the order in the linked list.
- **Interactive Interface**: Easily add, remove, and view nodes with Pygame, providing an intuitive way to interact with the data structure.
- **Python and Pygame**: Python for core functionality and Pygame for visual representation.
